# About

See the bottom of this page for hackathon styles employed in the Biological/Biomedical Data Science Space.

## Goal

Bringing people together to build tools to or perform advanced bioinformatics analysis.

## Products

- Some pipelines and other scripts, software and programs generated in the events will be added to public GitHub repositories designed for that purpose.

- A manuscript outlining the design and usage of the software tools constructed by each team may be submitted to an appropriate journal, such as the F1000Research Hackathons channel.

## Notes

Typically, participants will need to bring their own laptop to these programs.

## Hackathon styles employed by various institutions

### Biohackathon (DBCLS/NBDC)

    Duration: 5-7 days

    Time per day: 24 hours

    Goals: 
        - Open source infrastractures for data interoperability

        - Data integration

        - Identifiers, metadata, ontologies

    Main topics: Data Interoperability, Bioinformatics, Semantic Web, Machine Learning

    Frequency: 1 per year

    Conference associated: BioHackathon symposium (1 day)

### BOSC

    Duration: 2-4 days

    Time per day: variable

    Goals: 

        - Data Analysis

        - Tool-building

    Main topics: Bioinformatics, Workflows, Community Standards, Data Interoperability, Data Visualisation

    Frequency: 1 per year

    Conference associated: BOSC 

### European BioHackathon (Elixir/DBCLS/NBDC)

    Duration: 5 days
