## About this site

This site is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site, which is built and hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

It contains some modularity, namely:

- the html files in `_layouts/`
- the html files in `_includes/`
- the data files in `_data/`
- the front matter metadata in `pages/*.md`

To update the hackathon products or upcoming hackathon dates, edit the files in `_data/`.

Possible workflows for updating this site:

- via GitHub.com in a web browser
- via a text editor on a computer with a git connection to the remote repo
- via a computer with jekyll and git, etc.
